            <h1>Blood Death Knight Tank</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Blood Death Knight Tanking WOTLK guide! This guide's main purpose is to share the necessary information needed for you to have an in-depth understanding of the spec, as well as giving you options so you can determine how you'll want to play your character. This guide will cover not only the strengths and weaknesses of the spec, but the racial breakdowns, the best talent builds, professions, enchants, consumables, and rotations. This guide will be consistently updated to include every new phase, and any changes found in playstyle or gearing to ensure you have everything that you need to succeed as a Blood Death Knight Tank. Make sure to read and navigate through all of the pages of the guide to find more specific and in-depth information, as the individual pages will go more into the specifics.</p>
            <p>Death Knights are the first ever Hero class introduced into World of Warcraft. During the early patches of WOTLK Vanilla, all 3 specs for Death Knights could tank, but as we're only getting 3.3.5 in WOTLK Classic, only Blood is a viable tank spec. They use a mix of physical abilities and spells, much like Protection Paladins, to gain proper threat leads, self heal, and do damage. Death Knights wear plate armor like Warriors, and Paladins - which leads to large amounts of health and armor. Wrath introduces harder hitting bosses, and more difficult encounters, which means that these large health and armor pools really come in handy throughout the entire expansion. The number one thing Blood brings that other tanks don't is an insane self-sustain potential through self-healing. While its defensive cooldowns aren't as amazing as their other tanking counterparts, they're still strong. Death Knights in general are a very rewarding class that not only makes you manage a resource through spenders, but it also has Runes, its own system for using abilities.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best Tank specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Frost Death Knight DPS</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Frost Death Knight DPS WOTLK class guide! The goal of this guide is to give you an in-depth understanding of both the strengths and weaknesses of the spec, as well as giving you all the tools you need to improve your play to the next level and tackle every challenge WotLK has to offer. We'll cover everything from talent choices, BiS gearing choices, and rotational choices, as well as enchants, consumables, and racial choices. This guide is updated as the theory-crafting for the spec changes, so you're always up to date with the newest information from the community. Make sure to navigate to other pages of the guide to find more in-depth information, as each works as a knowledge hub for their subject.</p>
            <p>With the addition of the Death Knight class in WotLK, comes one of its two DPS specs, Frost. A melee damage dealing specialization, Frost DK wears plate much like Warriors and Paladins, and with that comes the increased armor and health pool inherent to the armor type. This resilience is a major strength for the class, as WotLk comes with a steep increase in raid difficulty from previous expansions, and with that an increase in damage taken for melee players. Frost provides an incredibly high burst window, both for AOE through  Howling Blast, and single target through  Obliterate and  Frost Strike, as well as a consistent damage profile outside of burst cooldowns. With gameplay built around managing the effective usage of your resources of Runes and Runic Power, and reacting to fast paced procs like  Killing Machine and  Rime, the spec promises an involved and engaging playstyle.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to Unholy Death Knight DPS WOTLK class guide! The goal of this guide is to give you an in-depth understanding of both the strengths and weaknesses of the spec, as well as giving you all the tools you need to improve your play to the next level and tackle every challenge WotLK has to offer.

                    <p>With the addition of the Death Knight class in WotLK, comes one of it's two DPS specs, Unholy. A melee damage dealing specialization, Unholy DK wears plate much like Warriors and Paladins, and with that comes the increased armor and health pool inherent to the armor type. This resilience is a major strength for the class, as WotLk comes with a steep increase in raid difficulty from previous expansions, and with that an increase in damage taken for melee players. Unholy provides high single target burst through the powerful cooldown  Summon Gargoyle, a summoned guardian that casts a damaging bolt every 2 seconds baseline, the true power of this cooldown comes with the fact that this guardian is affected by your attack power at the time of summoning and haste dynamically, allowing you to 'snapshot' things like  Rune of the Fallen Crusader and  Blood Fury. On top of this powerful single target burst, Unholy brings near unparalleled AOE damage over long periods, through empowered diseases from talents like  Impurity and  Rage of Rivendare, and the incredibly powerful  Wandering Plague which effectively scales the AOE damage you do infinitely with increased targets.</p>
