            <h1>Balance Druid DPS</h1>
            <p>Balance Druids are insanely fun to play in Wrath of the Lich King. Watching your screen fill up with damage numbers as you hit  Starfall and spam  Hurricane for massive AOE damage never gets old. You'll also be able to witness regular crits for huge amounts of damage. Wrath of the Lich King really brings the "Boom" to "Boomkin."</p>
            <p>Balance excels at AOE but can also hold their own on single target, although it will be hard to top the meters against some other specializations. The mana problems that Balance has notoriously had resolve considerably in Wrath of the Lich King due to the change to  Moonkin Form which now grants 2% mana return on crits.</p>
            <p>The rotation for Balance is also much more engaging with the addition of  Eclipse where you cycle between Lunar and Solar Eclipses which empower either your  Wrath or  Starfire.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best DPS specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Feral Druid DPS</h1>
            <p>Feral DPS was completely reworked from the ground up between TBC and WotLK, so returning Classic WoW Feral players will find that the spec they grew to love in vanilla and TBC Classic will feel very different to play in WotLK Classic. The core Classic Feral gameplay loop of powershifting and high APM decision making has been removed due to WotLK mechanics changes, and the spec is now much slower placed and revolves around carefully managing a myriad of buff and debuff timers for maximizing DPS. As a result, players who avoided cat DPS in TBC due to disliking the quirky gameplay of powershifting with Wolfshead Helm Wolfshead Helm should certainly consider giving the spec a shot in WotLK. Specifically, if you are a fan of DoT management specs like Affliction Warlock Warlock or enjoyed the Energy pooling aspect of Rogue Rogue PvE in TBC, then Feral DPS in WotLK will be right up your alley. Despite the core rotation changing dramatically from TBC, one common theme that won't change in WotLK is that the cat DPS rotation will remain one of the hardest to execute optimally across all specs in the game, so players who enjoyed Feral PvE in Classic thus far due to its difficulty ceiling will be able to scratch that same itch in WotLK.</p>
            <p>In conjunction with the reworked DPS rotation, WotLK also buffs the numerical performance of the Feral spec substantially compared to TBC. While exact DPS projections for each spec are still highly speculative at this point until simulation tools are more mature, it is safe to say that Feral DPS on single target encounters will be competitive with the top DPS specs in the game for at least the first two phases of WotLK, and will remain more than viable in competitive raid environments for the entirety of the expansion. Of particular importance to the competitive speedrunning meta in Classic WoW is the fact that cats are finally given a viable form of AoE damage via the introduction of  Swipe (Cat), which, while still not competitive with the best AoE classes like Warlock Warlocks except when the Feral's cooldowns are active, means that a Feral is no longer dead weight on large AoE trash pulls (which constitute the majority of time spent clearing most raids) like it was in TBC. As a hybrid tank/DPS spec, Feral also retains the advantage it had in TBC of being an excellent off-tank for speedruns, due to its ability to tank at over 90% effectiveness in a DPS optimized spec without incurring the 10 second respec timer, and this strength will be especially relevant in raids like Naxxramas where a second tank is only required on a small minority of encounters.</p>

                    <h1>Feral Druid Tank</h1>
                    <p>Unlike cat DPS, which was completely reworked from the ground up between TBC and WotLK, bear tanking will feel pretty much the same across the two expansions. The spec retains its core tanking strengths of a very high effective health pool (EHP) for soaking boss damage spikes, high single target Threat per second (TPS) and damage per second (DPS), and exceptional off-tanking capability due to the overlap between cat DPS and bear tanking talents + gear. WotLK changes also address pretty much all of the spec's weaknesses in TBC, providing bears with three useful defensive cooldowns and greatly improved AoE Threat generation. As a result, Feral tanks in WotLK will be capable of filling every conceivable tanking niche in 5-, 10-, and 25-man content, and can be leveraged as either main tanks or off-tanks in competitive raids throughout the expansion.</p>
                    <p>This being said, Feral tanks will no longer fill a unique raid niche like they did in TBC, since all four tanking classes were re-tuned in WotLK to generate more than adequate Threat even in heavy mitigation gear, and the introduction of dual specializations means that Warrior Warrior and Paladin Paladin tanks can also off-tank effectively simply by respeccing to a DPS build mid-raid as needed. The absurd avoidance scaling of Feral tanks in TBC has also been heavily curtailed in WotLK due to the introduction of diminishing returns on avoidance stats, so bears will no longer take substantially less damage than other tanks. The normalization of Threat and mitigation performance across all tanking classes in WotLK means that class choice for tanks primarily becomes a matter of personal preference, so feel free to pick whichever tank spec is most fun for you to play, as the choice will not make a noticeable difference even in hardcore competitive raiding environments.</p>

                    <h1>Restoration Druid Healer</h1>
                    <p>Resto Druids are a very engaging healing class in Wrath of the Lich King. The addition of  Wild Growth finally gives Resto some much needed area-of-effect healing, and the playstyles are now much more varied than The Burning Crusade's lifebloom juggling rotations. Resto Druid becomes a strong proactive raid healer, blanketing the entire raid with healing-over-time effects from  Wild Growth and  Rejuvenation. The new kit also allows the potential for stronger tank healing throughput, stacking as many healing-over-time effects on a tank and then using the new spell  Nourish for big and fast direct healing.</p>
                    <p>Overall, Resto Druid is a satisfying specialization to play with a lot of options for different damage patterns and scenarios. It may not always top the meters, but it brings strong healing at the moments that it's needed, some of the best utility, and high mobility.</p>
