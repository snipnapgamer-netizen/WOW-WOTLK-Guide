            <h1>Marksmanship Hunter DPS</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Marksmanship Hunter DPS class guide for WoTLK Classic. This guide will explain and break down everything you need to know regarding Marksmanship Hunters including strengths and weaknesses of the specialization, Viability of Marksmanship Hunters, Best-In-Slot gearing choices, rotations, enchants, consumables, as well as race choices. This guide will be kept up to date and adjusted as necessary as theorycrafting takes place and develops so be sure to check back often.</p>
            <p>While Hunters were known for their crazy high single target dps in TBCC and were arguably the best single target dps class. That is not so much the case in WoTLK. This is not to say however that hunters are no longer good dps though. Marksmanship Hunters will be the new dominant pve specialization and provide solid A tier dps.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best DPS specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

This is not to say however that hunters are no longer good dps though. Survival Hunters tend to perform well early on in WoTLK and fall off quite a bit towards the later phases due to Marksmanship scaling heavily with armor penetration gear which will be plentiful in later phases.</p>
