            <h1>Arcane Mage DPS</h1>
            <p>Arcane mage in Wrath of the Lich King is a front-loaded burst-based specialization using  Icy Veins and  Arcane Power, it will sustain good dps in short to medium length fights while providing acceptable support to the raid in form of percentage raid damage increase. It's one of the most interactive specializations Mages have, since it requires good cooldown and mana management alike. If what you're looking for is high burst, with consistent damage and raid spot security Arcane mage will be the spec for you for most of this expansion.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best DPS specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Fire Mage DPS</h1>
            <p>Fire mage in Wrath of the Lich King gets a full gameplay rework, now equipped with  Firestarter and  Hot Streak which allows for instant casts in both single target scenarios with  Pyroblast, and in AoE scenarios with instant casts of  Flamestrike at no mana cost. Although not a very front-loaded damage oriented spec, it sustains consistent damage throughout the fight and instead has a proper execution phase. Also significantly less mana constrained than its arcane counterpart.</p>

                    <h1>Frost Mage DPS</h1>
                    <p>Frost mages in Wrath of the Lich King sees the least change for PVE, they remain the lesser of the three specializations and see no significant gameplay changes. The rotation continues to be mostly  Frostbolt spamming, but now includes  Brain Freeze for instant cast  Frostfire Bolts, as well as  Fingers of Frost which allows for usage of  Deep Freeze on bosses. The damage isn't as bad as it was in TBC , since the spec is equipped with changes that were made towards the end of the expansion originally.</p>
