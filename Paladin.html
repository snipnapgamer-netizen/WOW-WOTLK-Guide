            <h1>Protection Paladin Tank</h1>
            <p>Protection Paladin is really the jack of all trades and master of none or so the saying goes, however fortunately the latter half of that figure of speech does not truly apply to us. Protection offers world class survivability, on top of having a toolkit that can go toe to toe with the other tanks in most cases. While we might not have the absolute best single-target threat as that award goes to Death Knights, we are competitive enough that it doesn't really matter. We might not have the highest armor or HP when compared to a druid, but that doesn't matter because we have  Ardent Defender which makes us an incredibly safe tank.</p>
            <p>The point being you will find us a very versatile spec with the ability to cover almost every range of tanking in Wrath of the Lich King while also bringing strong utility and is very easy to slot into a raid composition, making Protection Paladin a very lucrative tank.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best Tank specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Retribition Paladin DPS</h1>
            <p>The Retribution Paladin in wrath is a very solid melee dps class for the entirety of the game. While never the absolute top, it never drops down in rank either. It brings almost as good single target as the TBC paladin, while being able to turn into a cleave monster that almost competes with the fury warrior. It has the best sustainability in the game for solo content, as well as a massive defensive toolkit in PVP. Ret paladin also provides a lot of solo capabilities with the ability to have instant cast heals and being a very beefy plate wearer.</p>

            <h1>Holy Paladin Healer</h1>
            <p>Wrath of the Lich King is when Holy Paladins really come into their own, becoming a meta-defining powerhouse of a spec that excels in both PvE and PvP. In original Wrath of the Lich King, Paladins underwent a major overhaul of their systems to add a little more complexity and depth to each of the specs, and Holy Paladin is one of the biggest recipients of a "buff" in that regard. Though a lot of the spells function similarly to the TBC counterparts, additions of some maintenance buffs and an overall increased skill ceiling means that skill expression is at the forefront of this spec in WotLK.</p>
            <p>As a result, it means Holy Paladins are a core staple of PvE healing rosters, and a meta-defining S-tier healer in PvP. It will be virtually impossible to find a raid roster without a Holy Paladin and in 25-mans, even 2 are not going to be an uncommon sight. Suffice it to say, Holy Paladins are in a great spot in Wrath Classic and truly do well whether it's in dungeons, raids, battlegrounds, and Arenas.</p>
