            <h1>Assassination Rogue DPS</h1>
            <p>Assassination Rogues are very strong single-target damage dealers all throughout Wrath of the Lich King Classic. They are also less gear dependent than most other classes, able to deal high damage without all best in slot gear. Assassination Rogues generally suffer if they aren't able to spend enough time on a target to build up poisons,  Hunger For Blood, and combo points for  Envenom.</p>
            <p>As an Assassination Rogues you will provide the  Master Poisoner debuff for your raid, increasing the critical strike chance of everyone's attacks against enemies you have poisoned by 3%. This +3% critical strike chance debuff is shared with Retribution Paladins and Elemental Shamans. Applying different +3% critical strike chance debuffs does not provide additional benefit.</p>
            <p>All specializations of rogue will be able to offer  Tricks of the Trade to the raid. This exceptional spell can redirect threat and increase damage output. It is a very valuable utility spell that is highly desired to have in raids.</p>
            <p>Due to their high boss damage,  Master Poisoner debuff, and the utility provided by  Tricks of the Trade, Assassination Rogues are desirable choices as damage dealers in dungeons and raid groups throughout Wrath of the Lich King Classic, often times with multiple rogues in a 25 person group.</p>
            <p>While Rogue Rogue aren't as overpowered as they were in Burning Crusade Classic PvP, rogues are still good in Wrath of the Lich King Classic PvP. Compared to the normal Subtlety specialization for PvP, Assassination offers reduced mobility in favor of burst damage potential with back-to-back  Mutilates without needing to wait on a long cooldown.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best DPS specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Combat Rogue DPS</h1>
            <p>Combat Rogues use powerful cooldown abilities to deal big bursts of damage at just the right time to defeat their enemies. Combat is a easy specialization to learn and difficult to master - learning when is a good time to fire off your  Adrenaline Rush and other cooldowns and when to hold them takes practice. Of all the rogue specializations, Combat has the best multi-target damage potential with the strongest  Fan of Knives damage and the most energy available to pump into casting  Fan of Knives when it is needed.</p>
            <p>As a Combat Rogue you will provide the  Savage Combat debuff for your raid, increasing all physical damage dealt to enemies you have poisoned by 4%. This +4% physical damage debuff is shared with Arms Warriors. If your group already has an Arms Warrior or another Combat Rogue, there is no additional benefit to having two people apply the same debuff.</p>
            <p>All specializations of rogue will be able to offer  Tricks of the Trade to the raid. This exceptional spell can redirect threat and increase damage output. It is a very valuable utility spell that is highly desired to have in raids.</p>
            <p>Due to their high burst damage,  Savage Combat debuff, and the utility provided by  Tricks of the Trade, Combat Rogues are desirable choices as damage dealers in dungeons and raid groups throughout Wrath of the Lich King Classic.</p>
            <p>While Rogue Rogue aren't as overpowered as they were in Burning Crusade Classic PvP, rogues are still good in Wrath of the Lich King Classic PvP. Compared to the normal Subtlety specialization for PvP, Combat offers reduced mobility and reduced defensive abilities in favor of some pretty substantial burst damage with  Killing Spree. Subtlety is generally the preferred PvP specialization for Rogues in Wrath of the Lich King Classic.</p>

                    <h1>Subtlety Rogue DPS</h1>
                    <p>Subtlety Rogues are masters of stealth and mobility in combat. With access to the amazing  Shadowstep they can jump around the battlefield to attack whichever target they want, whenever they want to.  Preparation allows a Subtlety Rogue access to powerful cooldown abilities back-to-back if the situation calls for it, giving them great control and great defensive capabilities.  Shadow Dance has a huge variety of ways it can be used both for burst damage and for control.</p>
                    <p>As a Subtlety Rogue you will give the  Hemorrhage debuff for your raid. This debuff has limited charges and in a raid environment will quickly be consumed by the many players attacking the enemies. The Hemorrhage damage bonus is a unique debuff to the Rogue class - no other class in Wrath of the Lich King provides a buff that does the same thing or overwrites this debuff. You can think of each cast of Hemorrhage giving about 750 bonus damage distributed across your whole team.</p>
                    <p>All specializations of Rogue will be able to offer  Tricks of the Trade to the raid. This exceptional spell can redirect threat and increase damage output. It is a very valuable utility spell that is highly desired to have in raids. Subtlety Rogues in particular will be able to offer Tricks much more frequently than other Rogues due to their  Filthy Tricks talent.</p>
                    <p>Despite all these good things, Subtlety Rogues will generally bring less overall damage contribution to a raid team than a Assassination or Combat rogue. Subtlety is plenty good to play if you enjoy it but it is not considered a competitive PvE specialization for a Rogue.</p>
                    <p>While Rogue Rogue aren't as overpowered as they were in Burning Crusade Classic PvP, rogues are still very strong in Wrath of the Lich King Classic PvP. Subtlety offers insane mobility, control, and burst - everything you want to see in a class for PvP. The flexibility and power of the new  Shadow Dance spell makes Subtlety Rogues an extremely scary opponent to face in Arenas.</p>
