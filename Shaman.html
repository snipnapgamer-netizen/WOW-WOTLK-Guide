            <h1>Elemental Shaman DPS</h1>
            <p>Elemental Shaman Shamans are the masters of lightning in WoW, and have multiple fire and nature spells as well, making their rotation quite flashy. They bring arguably the most important group buff in the game, which changes depending on your faction:  Bloodlust /  Heroism.</p>
            <p>They can also bring multiple support buffs and need next to no gear to do great damage, although that also comes with poor scaling for the later phases of Wrath. Overall, it is a great caster class to play in PvE and a PvP powerhouse due to its strong burst damage and multiple disruptive tools, such as the new  Wind Shear.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best DPS specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Enhancement Shaman DPS</h1>
            <p>Enhancement Shaman Shamans become even more of a melee / spellcaster hybrid in Wrath thanks to  Maelstrom Weapon, which allows most Shaman spells to be cast instantly once 5 stacks are reached. Thanks to this and the introduction of new skills  Lava Lash and  Fire Nova, they have a much more complex rotation in Wrath which rewards skillful gameplay.</p>
            <p>They also bring most physical damage group buffs by themselves and arguably the most important group buff in the game, which changes depending on your faction:  Bloodlust /  Heroism.</p>
            <p>Finally, good scaling with gear ensures expansion-wide viability and makes Enhancement a great melee class to play with in both PvE and PvP scenarios, where its utility really shines thanks to multiple disruptive tools, such as the new  Wind Shear.</p>

                    <h1>Restoration Shaman Healer</h1>
                    <p>Restoration Shaman Shamans heal mostly through water and nature spells, with a few fire offensive spells on the side. They have an excellent balance between single target and area healing, and an engaging spell kit that allows for synergies between both types of healing, through the new  Tidal Waves talent and  Riptide's  Chain Heal boosting effect when used on a target with Riptide.</p>
                    <p>They also bring arguably the most important group buff in the game, which changes depending on your faction:  Bloodlust /  Heroism.</p>
                    <p>Finally, they bring multiple support buffs and have great group utility as well as a versatile new interrupt:  Wind Shear, which makes them very strong healers in PvP.</p>
