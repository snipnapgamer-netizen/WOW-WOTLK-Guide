            <h1>DPS Ranking explanation</h1>
            <h3 class="s">S Tier</h3>
            <p>The overall DPS throughput of these specs, including their raw single target damage, their practical performance in the context of Icecrown Citadel boss mechanics, and the synergy of their AoE toolkit with the desired damage profiles on ICC trash packs and cleave fights, is so high that stacking these specs can easily be justified in optimized raid comps. You will never go wrong adding another one of these to your roster.</p>
            <h3 class="a">A Tier</h3>
            <p>Bringing one of each of these specs should be viewed as mandatory in most competitive raid comps, and every single competitive raid team practicing on the ICC PTR used each of these in the roster. These specs either (a) offer unique raid DPS utility that is not covered by any other PvE specialization, or (b) condense multiple sources of redundant utility efficiently into a single raid spot, while (c) still providing sufficiently strong personal DPS throughput. Note that most specs in this tier will not be optimally stacked in late ICC, since additional members simply contribute less effective DPS than their S-tier brethren.</p>
            <h3 class="b">B Tier</h3>
            <p>This category is comprised of "strong but optional" specializations. Most optimized raid compositions will include a mixture of these specs due to the utility they provide, but none are mandatory to bring on their own since there are comparably strong alternative sources of their associated raid buffs or debuffs. However, the personal DPS output of the specs in this tier is still more than strong enough that bringing multiple to a raid is acceptable even if not optimal.</p>
            <h3 class="c">C Tier</h3>
            <p>These specs are only brought in competitive Phase 4 rosters to fill missing holes in the raid's suite of available raid buffs, cooldowns, or crowd control, as neither their personal DPS nor their raid utility are particularly impressive in a vacuum.</p>
            <h3 class="d">D Tier</h3>
            <p>The spec is technically viable, but is significantly outperformed by most other specs and does not bring enough utility to merit using it in lieu of alternative options.</p>

        <div id="furysumup">
            <h1>Tank Ranking explanation</h1>
            <h3 class="s">S Tier</h3>
            <p>This spec is a top tier choice for either the main tank or off-tank role in Icecrown Citadel across the entirety of Phase 4, including both early progression and later farm raids, due to its exceptional balance of survivability, utility, and total raid DPS contribution.</p>
            <h3 class="a">A Tier</h3>
            <p>This spec offers top-notch survivability for early Icecrown Citadel progression, but is overall much weaker than the S-tier specs over the bulk of Phase 4 due to its low DPS contribution.</p>
            <h3 class="c">C Tier</h3>
            <p>This spec is perfectly viable for tanking Phase 4 content, but struggles with survivability early on in the phase when under-geared.</p>

                    <h1>Healer Ranking explanation</h1>
                    <h3 class="s">S Tier</h3>
                    <p>The combined personal HPS plus raid utility contribution of this spec is so high that it is worth stacking 2 or more of them in an optimized raid comp.</p>
                    <h3 class="a">A Tier</h3>
                    <p>These specs should be viewed as mandatory healers to bring in any Phase 4 raid composition, but stacking more than one of each is often counterproductive.</p>
                    <h3 class="b">B Tier</h3>
                    <p>These specs are solid choices to round out a healing roster, but are not mandatory to bring and are surpassed by the S and A tier specs in throughput, utility, or both. These specs are optimally utilized as flex healers who can swap to a DPS build on fights with reduced healing requirements.</p>

                    <h1>PVP Ranking explanation</h1>
                    <h3 class="s">S Tier</h3>
                    <p>S Tier Specializations are just the strongest classes in Arena, period. These classes and specializations will be the most popular classes on the Arena ladder and will likely secure the most Rank 1 Titles throughout Wrath Classic, likely in every Season.</p>
                    <h3 class="a">A Tier</h3>
                    <p>A Tier Specializations are still extremely powerful and likely contenders for Rank 1 titles, they only fall short of S Tier because of the number of available compositions for them might be lower or not as strong.</p>
                    <h3 class="b">B Tier</h3>
                    <p>B Tier Specializations are still fantastic classes in Arena, only suffering because they are limited on team compositions that are truly viable for Gladiator or even Rank 1 titles. For many classes in this tier, they are also a bit more one dimensional and opposing teams know exactly what to expect from these specializations.</p>
                    <h3 class="c">C Tier</h3>
                    <p>C Tier Specializations are a bit more pigeon holed into arena brackets and team compositions, with only a handful of viable comps or what many consider to be "meme" compositions. Most classes in this category will only shine in 2v2, when they are considered unviable in other brackets.</p>
                    <h3 class="d">D Tier</h3>
                    <p>D Tier Specializations are the worst for Arena, pure Tank classes and extremely one dimensional classes would fall into this category. While it is still possible to be high on the ladder with these classes, finding Rank 1's as these specializations will be nearly impossible.</p>
