            <h1>Affliction Warlock DPS</h1>
            <p>Affliction Warlocks change from a support role in The Burning Crusade over to high throughput DPS in Wrath of the Lich King. The gameplay gets a significant overhaul for the better, no longer does Affliction essentially use the same rotation with perhaps one damage-over-time ability extra. The biggest reason for this is the significant changes that happen to  Corruption and  Drain Soul.</p>
            <p>The initial application of  Corruption can potentially keep going on forever thanks to  Everlasting Affliction. This talent keeps on refreshing your  Corruption when you cast either  Shadow Bolt,  Haunt, or  Drain Soul. But, that isn't everything it does. Due to the nature of the refresh and  Corruption being a damage-over-time ability some niche mechanics get introduced. Certain effects get recalculated when  Corruption is refreshed through  Everlasting Affliction, whilst others stay active based on the initial application and do not get applied when you get them after  Corruption is already up. Spells that keep being active even after the refresh is called effects that "roll over". The result of all this is that we want to get an as strong as possible initial application of  Corruption and keep it up as long as possible.</p>
            <p> Drain Soul only saw use for grinding out Soul Shard Soul Shard in the past. Those days are over,  Drain Soul now is major high damage dealing execute ability. Once the target reaches quarter health the damage increases by fourfold. This results in it instantly becoming the highest damage per second dealing ability (DoTs still deal more damage for the time it takes to apply them, hence you want to keep certain ones active still during the execute phase). Just like  Corruption has some special mechanics due to being a damage-over-time ability, the same happens to  Drain Soul because it is a channeled spell. Certain effects will snapshot and apply to the full duration of  Drain Soul upon application (and not apply if procced when already casting  Drain Soul, which could warrant casting the spell again to get them to apply). Besides that being a thing, you also want to keep certain DoTs up based on how long the fight will still last. This means you will have to cancel ( called "clipping") your  Drain Soul, reapply your DoT and recast  Drain Soul, all whilst keeping track of what snapshots.</p>

            <h1>Demonology Warlock DPS</h1>
            <p>Demonology Warlocks become more viable and sought after than any of the previous expansions. The biggest reason for this is  Demonic Pact, this talent causes your Felguard to become a buff god. Our spell power is always in flux due to cooldowns and procs. What this means for  Demonic Pact is that the amount of spell power it provides also is variable. The way it works is that stronger versions (aka that provide more spell power can overwrite weaker ones after a 5-second internal cooldown. The last 10 seconds of the buff weaker versions also can overwrite stronger ones, this decreases the odds of  Demonic Pact falling off.</p>
            <p>We don't only provide a lot of spell power via  Demonic Pact. We also have great burst damage and cleave DPS. Releasing our inner demon with  Metamorphosis we become Illidan's little brother. Whilst in demon form we deal 20% more damage plus we unlock a couple of unique abilities which can further our damage.  Immolation Aura and  Shadow Cleave significantly increase our DPS if we are cleaving enemies within the melee range. A Demonology Warlock that knows when to use and how to use  Metamorphosis will stand out from the rest.</p>
            <p>Being the cool Warlock specialization we also like to switch it up when it comes to our filler spells.  Shadow Bolt is the main filler spell that we use, but whenever  Molten Core procs from  Corruption we will be spamming  Incinerate. And once our targets are about to die we get out the big guns with  Soul Fire.</p>

                    <h1>Destruction Warlock DPS</h1>
                    <p>Destruction has always been key and center when it comes to raiding for Warlocks in previous expansions. Come Wrath of the Lich King more options open up with Affliction and Demonology taking a step forward and both becoming great options each with their niche. However, that doesn't mean that Destruction isn't a viable option anymore. If anything Destruction has seen some reworks which finally fully support being a Fire Warlock like how we have been dreaming about ever since we learned  Searing Pain.  Incinerate becomes our main filler spell, along with  Conflagrate and  Chaos Bolt that we will use on cooldown mixed with keeping  Immolate up at all times. Raining down fel fire on all who stand to oppose us.</p>
                    <p>We get a lot more to play around with instead of only casting  Shadow Bolt. The biggest overhaul is seen to  Conflagrate which finally sees use inside player versus environment.  Fire and Brimstone causes  Conflagrate to crit more often then not. Glyph of Conflagrate Glyph of Conflagrate in turn keeps us from having to recast  Immolate every 10 seconds. Another major selling point is  Backdraft, the increase in casting speed not only a DPS increase but also feels great.</p>
                    <p> Improved Soul Leech is another big boon for Destruction Warlocks, and with it we finally bring support to the raid.</p>
