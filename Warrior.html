            <h1>Protection Warrior Tank</h1>
            <p>In Wrath of the Lich King, the Protection Warrior Warrior is a high damage and high threat tank, with great CC capabilities and mobility.</p>
            <p>Thanks to a deep overhaul of the Protection talent tree, it is one of the most fun classes to play. It has an engaging yet intensive rotation paired with unpredictable procs keeping you on your toes at all times.</p>
            <p>The Protection Warrior Warrior performs well in dungeons and raids as a high threat tank with amazing AoE capabilities, and even in PvP for the first time thanks to a large arsenal of CC paired with great burst and mobility.</p>
            <p>If you are the type of person who likes to choose your class based on its power in the current raid, we have prepared a Tier List that goes over the best Tank specs in the current raid tier and an explanation on why from our Class Writers.</p>

            <h1>Fury Warrior DPS</h1>
            <p>Fury Warrior enjoys a number of strengths in WotLK, including strong cleave, exceptional cooldowns, and high scaling with gear. With the ability to dual wield Two Handed Weapons, Fury Warriors enjoy dealing high levels of damage through their powerful swings and high damaging crits.</p>
            <p>While Fury Warriors may not perform better than other melee early on in the expansion, their talents and core mechanics allow them to scale better than most, if not all, DPS specs. As Armor Penetration rating becomes more common, along with increasing levels of Critical Strike rating, Fury Warrior becomes a spec that can easily compete for the title of "Best".</p>

                <div id="armssumup">
            <h1>Arms Warrior DPS</h1>
            <p>Arms Warrior enjoys a small but notable niche in sustained 2 target cleave, along with very strong burst 4 target cleave with their main DPS Cooldown,  Bladestorm. With a fluid rotation based around procs and bleeds, Arms excels at focusing down one target while viciously dismantling any additional enemies that might wander too close.</p>
            <p>However, Arms is not without its flaws. Due to being a Bleed focused spec, the spec scales poorly compared to its other Melee competitors, and suffers from a lack of a strong general use in later tiers. Regardless, Arms' smooth gameplay makes it a very enjoyable spec to play.</p>
